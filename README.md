# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains various Python scripts I'm working on to practice my Python skills. Each script solves a basic Python problem or implements a small learning exercise.

## Project Structure

* The files in this folder represent different Python problems I'm tackling.
* Each file has a descriptive name that reflects its purpose (e.g., `Snake_Game_Pygame.py`).

## Snake Game with Pygame (Snake_Game_Pygame.py)

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to avoid hitting the walls or your own tail. This project implements a simple snake game using Python's Pygame library.

**Description:**

*The game features a snake that moves around the screen using the arrow keys.
*The snake grows longer each time it eats a piece of food (represented by a square).
*The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own tail.
*The score is displayed on the screen, and it increases with each piece of food eaten.

**Key libraries and concepts used:**

Pygame: A popular Python library for creating multimedia applications, including games.
Event handling: Detecting user input (e.g., key presses) to control the snake's movement.
Collision detection: Checking if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
Game loop: The core structure of the game that continuously updates the game state and redraws the screen.

**Learning objectives:**

*This project provides an opportunity to practice fundamental Python programming concepts like variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.
*It introduces you to Pygame for creating interactive games and working with graphics in Python.
*You'll gain experience in game design principles, including game mechanics, user input handling, and collision detection.)

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

**Instructions:**

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
2. Run the script using:  `python Snake_Game_Pygame.py`
